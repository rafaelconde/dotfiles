A similarly named package: linter-flow-plus is now a mirror. The development happens for both packages in parallel.\n2. IDE-flow works relatively well, but it doesn't lint on-the-fly and doesn't integrate with the linter package.\n3. Nuclide has too many problems for now to be reliable. It also involves installing a large number of other packages.\n\nPlease Note: IDE-flow and Nuclide provide other features such as autocomplete, type definitions on hover etc. Please continue to use those services for those features. (possibly in addition to linter-flow)\n\n### Limitations\n\nThis linter currently does not support Hack. Though the linter just uses the flow-cli and hack support should be trivial to add, I'm not a Hack/PHP developer and I can't test that it actually works. I would welcome if someone was to add support for Hack to this package and test it.\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you would like to contribute enhancements or fixes, please do the following:\n\n1. Fork the plugin repository\n2. Hack on a separate topic branch created from the latest `master`\n3. Commit and push the topic branch\n4. Make a pull request\n5. Welcome to the club!\n\nPlease note that modifications should follow these coding guidelines:\n\n* Indent is 2 spaces with `.editorconfig`\n* Code should pass `eslint` linter with the provided `.eslintrc`\n* Vertical whitespace helps readability, donâ€™t be afraid to use it\n\n**Thank you for helping out!**\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/AtomLinter/linter-flow/issues"},"_id":"linter-flow@5.5.0","_shasum":"0c8aad1b27b5c216e71c505cf6d074b32b8f9826","_resolved":"file:../d-11722-1482-19rilda/package.tgz","_from":"../d-11722-1482-19rilda/package.tgz"}
