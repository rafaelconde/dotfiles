The parameters passed to `cb` are standard error-first:\n\n  - If `promise` is fulfilled, then it is called with the result of the promise: `cb(null, result)`\n  - If `promise` is rejected, then it is called with the rejection error: `cb(err)`\n\nIf `cb` is falsey, then `promise` is retuned.\n","maintainers":[{"name":"limulus","email":"eric@limulus.net"}],"time":{"modified":"2018-02-14T01:30:10.307Z","created":"2015-09-11T20:33:55.292Z","1.0.0":"2015-09-11T20:33:55.292Z","1.0.1":"2015-09-12T20:55:39.573Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/limulus/call-me-maybe#readme","keywords":["promise","callback","denodeify","promisify","carlyraejepsen"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/limulus/call-me-maybe.git"},"author":{"name":"Eric McCarthy","email":"eric@limulus.net","url":"http://www.limulus.net/"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/limulus/call-me-maybe/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"bigstickcarpet":true,"leonzhao":true,"jochemstoel":true,"zhangaz1":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"5a839122-fdb\"","_lastModified":"Wed, 14 Feb 2018 1:30:10 GMT"}
