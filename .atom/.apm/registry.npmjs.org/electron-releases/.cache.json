electron-releases \n\n> Complete and up-to-date info about every release of Electron.\n\nThis package:\n\n- includes all [GitHub Releases](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#get-a-single-release) data about Electron.\n- does not include draft releases.\n- includes prereleases which are not published to npm.\n- tracks which versions are published to npm.\n- tracks [npm dist-tags](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/dist-tag) like `latest` and `beta`.\n- includes V8, Chromium, and Node.js version data.\n- includes [GitHub-flavored HTML](https://ghub.io/hubdown) for each release's changelog.\n- ignores npm versions from the days before [Electron was `electron`](https://electronjs.org/blog/npm-install-electron).\n- is [updated regularly](#updates).\n\n## Installation\n\n```sh\nnpm i electron-releases\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nThe module exports an array of release objects:\n\n```js\nconst releases = require('electron-releases')\n\n// find newest version:\nreleases[0].tag_name // => 'v1.8.2-beta.3'\n\n// find `latest` on npm, which is not necessarily the most recent release:\nreleases.find(release => release.npm_dist_tag === 'latest')\n\n// find `beta` on npm:\nreleases.find(release => release.npm_dist_tag === 'beta')\n```\n\n### Data\n\nEach release contains all the data returned by the \n[GitHub Releases API](https://developer.github.com/v3/repos/releases/#get-a-single-release), \nplus some extra properties:\n\n- `version` (String) - the same thing as `dist_tag`, but without the `v` for convenient [semver comparisons](https://github.com/npm/node-semver#usage).\n- `npm_dist_tag` (String) - an [npm dist-tag](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/dist-tag) like `latest` or `beta`. Most releases will not have this property.\n- `npm_package_name` (String) - For packages published to npm, this will be `electron` or `electron-prebuilt`. For packages not published to npm, this property will not exist.\n- `total_downloads` (Number) - Total downloads of all assets in the release that \n  have a [detectable platform](https://github.com/zeke/platform-utils#api) in their\n  filename like `.zip`, `.dmg`, `.exe`, `.rpm`, `.deb`, etc.\n- `deps` (Object) - version numbers for Electron dependencies.\n  - `v8` (String)\n  - `chromium` (String)\n  - `node` (String)\n  - etc..\n\n## Updates\n\nThis module is self-publishing. It runs in a \n[Heroku Scheduler](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/scheduler) \nprocess every ten minutes. A new version of this module is published if any of \nthe following change:\n\n- number of Electron releases on GitHub\n- number of Electron releases on npm\n- npm `electron@beta` version\n- npm `electron@latest` version\n\nIf none of these has changed, the build process aborts and runs again ten minutes\nlater. For more detail, see [script/release.sh](script/release.sh)\n\nThe Heroku app is also synced to the GitHub repo, so every push to the\n`master` branch will automatically deploy a new version of this app.\n\n## Tests\n\n```sh\nnpm install\nnpm test\n```\n\n## Dependencies\n\nNone\n\n## Dev Dependencies\n\n- [chai](https://github.com/chaijs/chai): BDD/TDD assertion library for node.js and the browser.
