  "readme": "# linter-flow\n\nLightweight alternative to Facebook's Flow plugin for [facebook/flow](http://flowtype.org/).\n\n![linter-demo](https://naman.s3.amazonaws.com/linter-flow-plus/linter-flow-plus.gif)\n\n## Installation\n\n* Install [flow](http://flowtype.org/docs/getting-started.html#installing-flow)\n* `flow init`\n* `apm install linter-flow`\n\n## Settings\n\nYou can configure linter-flow by editing ~/.atom/config.cson (choose Open Your Config in Atom menu) or in Preferences:\n\n```cson\n'linter-flow':\n  'executablePath': 'flow'\n  'enableAll': false\n```\n\n* `executablePath`: Absolute path to the Flow executable on your system.\n* `enableAll`: Typecheck all files, not just file containing `@flow`.\n\n### Why not X?\n\nlinter-flow is made to be a lightweight package that does one thing well.\n\n1. A similarly named package: linter-flow-plus is now a mirror. The development happens for both packages in parallel.\n2. IDE-flow works relatively well, but it doesn't lint on-the-fly and doesn't integrate with the linter package.\n3. Nuclide has too many problems for now to be reliable. It also involves installing a large number of other packages.\n\nPlease Note: IDE-flow and Nuclide provide other features such as autocomplete, type definitions on hover etc. Please continue to use those services for those features. (possibly in addition to linter-flow)\n\n### Limitations\n\nThis linter currently does not support Hack. Though the linter just uses the flow-cli and hack support should be trivial to add, I'm not a Hack/PHP developer and I can't test that it actually works. I would welcome if someone was to add support for Hack to this package and test it.\n\n## Contributing\n\nIf you would like to contribute enhancements or fixes, please do the following:\n\n1. Fork the plugin repository\n2. Hack on a separate topic branch created from the latest `master`\n3. Commit and push the topic branch\n4. Make a pull request\n5. Welcome to the club!\n\nPlease note that modifications should follow these coding guidelines:\n\n* Indent is 2 spaces with `.editorconfig`\n* Code should pass `eslint` linter with the provided `.eslintrc`\n* Vertical whitespace helps readability, donâ€™t be afraid to use it\n\n**Thank you for helping out!**\n",
